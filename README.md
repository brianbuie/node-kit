# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- `Log` reverted to previous custom implementation, no more pino
  - `Log.alert` (was `Log.fatal`)
  - Fixed log levels for Google Cloud
  - New `isGcloud` and `isProd` properties (defaults from `process.env`)
- `Fetcher` added new options to override transport and delay methods
- `Cache` uses config object instead of multiple args. Added options for `path`.
- `TypeWriter` is now a separate export
  - `quicktype-core` needs to be installed as a dependency in projects that use it
  - Needs to be imported from "@brianbuie/node-kit/TypeWriter"
- `File` refactored to `FileBase` that's inherited by all file types
  - If projects relied on `instanceof File`, that won't work anymore.

## 1.0.0

- `File` Breaking changes,
  - Removed intermediate `FileType` class, all types now inherit from `File`
  - Base `File` class
    - `read()` → `readText()`
    - `write()` → `writeText()` and doesn't handle writing from stream anymore
    - `writeStream()` is a method now and writes from readable stream
    - `get writeStream` → `get writable`
    - `get readStream` → `get readable`
    - `lines()` → `readTextLines()`
    - `append()` → `appendTextLines()`
  - None of the file types can be constructed with initial data anymore, since some of the writes are async and some file types have additional options, which is confusing.
    - The `File.json`, `File.csv`, etc. methods do still allow initial data, since that creation method can be async
  - The other methods on specific file types should be the same as before.
- All class methods now use arrow functions, to prevent binding issues.
- `Cmd.ffmpeg` and `Cmd.ffprobe` look for `process.env.FFMPEG_PATH` and `process.env.FFPROBE_PATH` locations

## 0.16.1

- New `Cmd` utility for running shell commands, handling output and errors
  - `Cmd.ffmpeg` and `Cmd.ffprobe` added with basic config for handling output (ffmpeg and ffprobe need to be installed separately)
- New `FileTypeImage` and `FileTypeVideo` extensions with methods to get media dimensions

## 0.16.0

- `Log` rewritten using [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) under the hood. Will require updates in projects:
  - `message` is still first argument, but second argument should include all details, instead of using an arbitrary number of args
  - Errors should use the `err` key in the details object, instead of passing the error as an argument
  - Dev defaults to `debug` level, prod defaults to `info`, use `LOG_LEVEL=info` env variable
  - Removed `alert` and `notice` levels
  - New `fatal` level above `error`
  - New `trace` level, below `debug`
- `Dir.txtFiles` renamed from `Dir.textFiles`, for consistency with other file types
- `JsonFileType` & `NdJsonFileType` no longer user the `snapshot` hack to stringify special objects. Will remove `snapshot` in the future.
- `FileTypeCsv`
  - Second argument changed from `keys` array to options object (`keys` can be provided as option)
  - Automatic parsing of numbers, booleans, and nulls can be disabled (`parseNumbers`, `parseBooleans`, `parseNulls`)
- Removed `@types/node` as peer dependency
- Added explicit return types for everything

## 0.15.1

- `Dir` uses YYYYMMDD as default name
- `File` uses YYYYMMDD-HHmmss as default name

## 0.15.0

- `TypeWriter` option for `outFile`, defaults to `[moduleName].types.ts`

# Development

Typecheck and run all tests from `*.test.ts` files

```
npm run test
```

Format with Prettier, generate API docs for this Readme

```
npm run build
```

Release a new version

- runs test and build
- If no unstaged changes, creates a new commit with version tag (`preversion` script in package.json)
- Pushes to github (`postversion` script in package.json)
- Triggers github workflow that publishes to npm

```
npm version [patch|minor|major]
```
